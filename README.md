# Oscorp NIST SP 800-53 GRC Assessment Project

## 📌 Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) assessment conducted for a simulated organization, **Oscorp**, using the **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** framework. The project demonstrates a structured, enterprise-style cybersecurity assessment lifecycle, including asset identification, risk assessment, NIST baseline assessment, control mapping, control evaluation, policy mapping, gap analysis, and the development of a prioritized security roadmap.

This project is designed as a professional portfolio artifact to showcase practical GRC skills, risk-based methodology, and alignment with globally recognized cybersecurity standards.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

* Identify critical organizational assets and dependencies
* Analyze cybersecurity risks based on threats and vulnerabilities
* Assess the organization’s current security posture using NIST standards
* Map risks to NIST SP 800-53 control families and controls
* Evaluate control implementation status (Implemented / Partially Implemented / Not Implemented)
* Assess governance and policy maturity
* Identify gaps between current and required security states
* Develop prioritized recommendations and a phased security roadmap
* Consolidate findings into a professional GRC assessment report

## 🧭 GRC Lifecycle & Methodology

The assessment follows a structured, risk-based GRC workflow:

**Scenario → Assets → Risks → NIST Assessment → Control Mapping → Control Evaluation → Policy Mapping → Gap Analysis → Recommendations → Reporting**

### Methodological Steps

1. Scenario Analysis – Understanding Oscorp’s operational and cybersecurity context
2. Asset Identification – Cataloging critical systems, data, and infrastructure
3. Risk Assessment – Identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and calculating risk scores
4. NIST Baseline Assessment – Evaluating current security posture against NIST SP 800-53
5. Control Mapping – Linking identified risks to relevant NIST controls
6. Control Evaluation – Assessing control implementation status and effectiveness
7. Policy Mapping – Evaluating organizational policies against NIST requirements
8. Gap Analysis – Identifying deviations between current and desired security states
9. Recommendations & Roadmap – Developing prioritized remediation actions
10. Final Reporting – Consolidating findings into a professional GRC report

## 🛡 Frameworks & Standards Applied

* **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** – Security and Privacy Controls
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
* Risk-based assessment methodology
* Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) principles

---

## 📊 Key Assessment Areas

The assessment focuses on the following cybersecurity domains:

* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Data Protection and Cryptography
* Security Monitoring and Logging
* Incident Response and Detection
* Governance and Security Strategy
* Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk

---

## 📉 Summary of Findings (High-Level)

The assessment identified several critical weaknesses in Oscorp’s cybersecurity posture:

* Absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and weak access control mechanisms
* Lack of centralized security monitoring and SIEM capabilities
* Insufficient data protection and encryption controls
* Weak cybersecurity governance and absence of formal security strategy
* Lack of structured third-party risk management processes

Approximately **60–70% of assessed NIST SP 800-53 controls** were found to be **Not Implemented** or **Partially Implemented**, indicating a low to moderate security maturity level.
