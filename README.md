## 📖 Executive Summary

This repository presents a **full-scale professional Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) cybersecurity assessment** conducted for a fictional Small/Medium Enterprise (SME), **Oscorp**.

The project simulates a real-world cybersecurity consulting engagement using globally recognized frameworks:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5
- Risk-based GRC methodology

The assessment evaluates Oscorp’s current security posture, identifies risks and gaps, maps them to NIST controls, defines a target security state, and delivers a prioritized remediation roadmap.

This repository is designed as a **professional cybersecurity GRC portfolio project**, demonstrating real consulting-style deliverables.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of this GRC assessment are:

- Identify and classify critical business and IT assets  
- Assess cybersecurity risks impacting organizational assets  
- Evaluate existing security controls against NIST standards  
- Identify gaps between current and required controls  
- Map risks and gaps to NIST SP 800-53 controls  
- Define a realistic Information Security Target State (IST)  
- Develop a structured and prioritized security improvement roadmap  

---

## 🏢 Organizational Context — Oscorp (SME Model)

Oscorp is modeled as a modern SME with the following characteristics:

- Cloud-centric infrastructure (Microsoft Azure & Office 365)
- Active Directory-based identity management
- Dependency on SaaS applications (e.g., Horizon Labs)
- Limited formal cybersecurity governance
- Partial technical controls but weak monitoring and governance

This scenario reflects real-world cybersecurity challenges faced by many SMEs.

| Domain                         | Maturity Level |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| Governance & Strategy          | Low          |
| Identity & Access Management   | Low          |
| Monitoring & Detection         | Low          |
| Incident Response              | Low          |
| Data Security                  | Low          |
| Vulnerability Management       | Medium-Low   |
| Network Security               | Medium       |
| Business Continuity & Recovery | Medium       |
| Overall Security Posture       | Low–Medium   |

## 🎯 Information Security Target State (IST)

The target state aims to elevate Oscorp’s cybersecurity maturity from **Low/Medium** to **Medium/High**, focusing on:

- Strong identity and access management (MFA, PAM, RBAC)
- Centralized security monitoring and detection (SIEM)
- Formal governance and risk management
- Data protection and classification (DLP, encryption)
- Structured incident response capability
- Vendor and third-party risk governance

---

## 🗺️ Strategic Security Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Quick Wins (0–3 Months)

- Deploy MFA and eliminate shared admin accounts  
- Establish core security policies  
- Formalize vulnerability management  

### Phase 2 — Core Security Controls (3–6 Months)

- Implement SIEM and centralized logging  
- Develop incident response framework  
- Implement data classification and DLP  

### Phase 3 — Security Maturity & Optimization (6–12 Months)

- Deploy PAM and SOC capabilities  
- Conduct periodic risk assessments  
- Strengthen third-party risk management
